[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbot_waypoint_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "bot_waypoint_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "bot_waypoint_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    bot_waypoint_msgsConfig.cmake
    bot_waypoint_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "bot_waypoint_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "bot_waypoint_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "bot_waypoint_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
